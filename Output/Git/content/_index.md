## Scope of the document:
This document explains how to install Git and additional tools to set up.

## Pre-requisites:
Download and install Visual Studio 2019 or later. You need to turn on the .Net desktop development workflow (all others are optional).

Download and install WinMerge. Make sure that this is in the path (turn on the Add WinMerge folder to your system path) switch when you install this. (The Flux.Test system uses WinMergeU.exe to display differences in text files).

Download and install Notepad++. This is not strictly required, but is convenient to use as a message editor from Git. If you skip this, choose Notepad instead of Notepad++ when installing Git.

Download and install the ODA File Converter from the OpenDesign alliance. Flux uses this for importing DWG files (by converting them to DXF) and if you do not install this, a few Flux tests related to DWG import will fail.
