### Set up name and e-mail
Set up your e-mail address (use all lowercase), and name (also with all lower-case and with no space), like **gandalf** or **boromir** or **tombombadil**. If your first name is unambiguous enough (in other words, you are an old-timer) use just that. Otherwise use both first and last names. Do not use an initial.
```
git config --global user.name boromir
git config --global user.email boromir@gondor.org
```
